The dataset contains the following columns:

Unnamed: 0: An index column that can be ignored.
Sq_Ft_Tot_Living: Total living area in square feet.
Sq_Ft_Lot: Lot size in square feet.
Bathroom_count: Number of bathrooms.
Bedroom_count: Number of bedrooms.
Bldg_Grade: Building grade.
House_Sale_Price: Sale price of the house (target variable).
We'll use this dataset to fit SVM and Random Forest models. However, since House_Sale_Price is a continuous variable, we need to convert it into categorical values to apply classification models. Let's bin the house prices into categories (e.g., low, medium, high) based on quantiles.

n machine learning, the type of target variable determines the kind of model that should be used:

Regression Models: Used when the target variable is continuous (e.g., predicting house prices).
Classification Models: Used when the target variable is categorical (e.g., classifying emails as spam or not spam).
House_Sale_Price as a Continuous Variable
House_Sale_Price in the dataset represents the price of houses, which is a continuous variable because it can take any numerical value within a range. If you want to predict the exact price of a house, you would use a regression model such as Linear Regression or Random Forest Regressor.

Converting Continuous to Categorical
To use classification models like SVM and Random Forest Classifier, we need to convert the continuous House_Sale_Price into discrete categories. This process is known as binning or discretization. In this example, I binned the house prices into three categories:

Low: Houses with prices in the lowest third of the dataset.
Medium: Houses with prices in the middle third of the dataset.
High: Houses with prices in the highest third of the dataset.
Why Convert to Categorical?
By converting the house prices to categories, we can frame the problem as a classification task. This allows us to use classification algorithms to predict the price category (low, medium, high) of a house based on its features.

Example of Binning
Let's consider a small example:

Original house prices: [100,000, 200,000, 300,000, 400,000, 500,000, 600,000]
After binning into three categories:
Low: [100,000, 200,000]
Medium: [300,000, 400,000]
High: [500,000, 600,000]
Using pandas.qcut, we can automatically bin the data into quantiles (e.g., tertiles, quartiles, etc.).

How We Applied It
In the provided code, we used pd.qcut to create three categories of house prices. Hereâ€™s a snippet from the code:

price_bins = pd.qcut(data['House_Sale_Price'], q=3, labels=['low', 'medium', 'high'])
data['Price_Category'] = price_bins

This code divides the House_Sale_Price into three equal-sized bins and assigns each house price to one of the three categories: 'low', 'medium', or 'high'.

Summary
Continuous Variable: House prices that can take any value.
Categorical Variable: Binned house prices into categories like 'low', 'medium', 'high'.
Binning: Process of converting continuous variables into categorical ones.
By binning the continuous house prices, we transformed a regression problem into a classification problem, allowing us to use SVM and Random Forest Classifier to predict the price category of a house.
